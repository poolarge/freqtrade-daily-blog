# Configure the bot¶

Freqtrade has many configurable features and possibilities.
By default, these settings are configured via the configuration file (see below).

## The Freqtrade configuration file¶

The bot uses a set of configuration parameters during its operation that all together conform to the bot configuration. It normally reads its configuration from a file (Freqtrade configuration file).

Per default, the bot loads the configuration from theconfig.jsonfile, located in the current working directory.

`config.json`

You can specify a different configuration file used by the bot with the-c/--configcommand-line option.

`-c/--config`

If you used theQuick startmethod for installing
the bot, the installation script should have already created the default configuration file (config.json) for you.

`config.json`

If the default configuration file is not created we recommend to usefreqtrade new-config --config user_data/config.jsonto generate a basic configuration file.

`freqtrade new-config --config user_data/config.json`

The Freqtrade configuration file is to be written in JSON format.

Additionally to the standard JSON syntax, you may use one-line// ...and multi-line/* ... */comments in your configuration files and trailing commas in the lists of parameters.

`// ...`
`/* ... */`

Do not worry if you are not familiar with JSON format -- simply open the configuration file with an editor of your choice, make some changes to the parameters you need, save your changes and, finally, restart the bot or, if it was previously stopped, run it again with the changes you made to the configuration. The bot validates the syntax of the configuration file at startup and will warn you if you made any errors editing it, pointing out problematic lines.

### Environment variables¶

Set options in the Freqtrade configuration via environment variables.
This takes priority over the corresponding value in configuration or strategy.

Environment variables must be prefixed withFREQTRADE__to be loaded to the freqtrade configuration.

`FREQTRADE__`

__serves as level separator, so the format used should correspond toFREQTRADE__{section}__{key}.
As such - an environment variable defined asexport FREQTRADE__STAKE_AMOUNT=200would result in{stake_amount: 200}.

`__`
`FREQTRADE__{section}__{key}`
`export FREQTRADE__STAKE_AMOUNT=200`
`{stake_amount: 200}`

A more complex example might beexport FREQTRADE__EXCHANGE__KEY=<yourExchangeKey>to keep your exchange key secret. This will move the value to theexchange.keysection of the configuration.
Using this scheme, all configuration settings will also be available as environment variables.

`export FREQTRADE__EXCHANGE__KEY=<yourExchangeKey>`
`exchange.key`

Please note that Environment variables will overwrite corresponding settings in your configuration, but command line Arguments will always win.

Common example:

```
FREQTRADE__TELEGRAM__CHAT_ID=<telegramchatid>
FREQTRADE__TELEGRAM__TOKEN=<telegramToken>
FREQTRADE__EXCHANGE__KEY=<yourExchangeKey>
FREQTRADE__EXCHANGE__SECRET=<yourExchangeSecret>
```

Json lists are parsed as json - so you can use the following to set a list of pairs:

```
export FREQTRADE__EXCHANGE__PAIR_WHITELIST='["BTC/USDT", "ETH/USDT"]'
```

Note

Environment variables detected are logged at startup - so if you can't find why a value is not what you think it should be based on the configuration, make sure it's not loaded from an environment variable.

Validate combined result

You can use theshow-config subcommandto see the final, combined configuration.

Environment variables are loaded after the initial configuration. As such, you cannot provide the path to the configuration through environment variables. Please use--config path/to/config.jsonfor that.
This also applies touser_dirto some degree. while the user directory can be set through environment variables - the configuration willnotbe loaded from that location.

`--config path/to/config.json`
`user_dir`

### Multiple configuration files¶

Multiple configuration files can be specified and used by the bot or the bot can read its configuration parameters from the process standard input stream.

You can specify additional configuration files inadd_config_files. Files specified in this parameter will be loaded and merged with the initial config file. The files are resolved relative to the initial configuration file.
This is similar to using multiple--configparameters, but simpler in usage as you don't have to specify all files for all commands.

`add_config_files`
`--config`

Validate combined result

You can use theshow-config subcommandto see the final, combined configuration.

Use multiple configuration files to keep secrets secret

You can use a 2ndconfiguration file containing your secrets. That way you can share your "primary" configuration file, while still keeping your API keys for yourself.
The 2ndfile should only specify what you intend to override.
If a key is in more than one of the configurations, then the "last specified configuration" wins (in the above example,config-private.json).

`config-private.json`

For one-off commands, you can also use the below syntax by specifying multiple "--config" parameters.

```
freqtrade trade --config user_data/config1.json --config user_data/config-private.json <...>
```

The below is equivalent to the example above - but having 2 configuration files in the configuration, for easier reuse.

```
"add_config_files": [
    "config1.json",
    "config-private.json"
]
```

```
freqtrade trade --config user_data/config.json <...>
```

If the same configuration setting takes place in bothconfig.jsonandconfig-import.json, then the parent configuration wins.
In the below case,max_open_tradeswould be 3 after the merging - as the reusable "import" configuration has this key overwritten.

`config.json`
`config-import.json`
`max_open_trades`

```
{
    "max_open_trades": 3,
    "stake_currency": "USDT",
    "add_config_files": [
        "config-import.json"
    ]
}
```

```
{
    "max_open_trades": 10,
    "stake_amount": "unlimited",
}
```

Resulting combined configuration:

```
{
    "max_open_trades": 3,
    "stake_currency": "USDT",
    "stake_amount": "unlimited"
}
```

If multiple files are in theadd_config_filessection, then they will be assumed to be at identical levels, having the last occurrence override the earlier config (unless a parent already defined such a key).

`add_config_files`

## Editor autocomplete and validation¶

If you are using an editor that supports JSON schema, you can use the schema provided by Freqtrade to get autocompletion and validation of your configuration file by adding the following line to the top of your configuration file:

```
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.freqtrade.io/schema.json",
}
```

The develop schema is available ashttps://schema.freqtrade.io/schema_dev.json- though we recommend to stick to the stable version for the best experience.

`https://schema.freqtrade.io/schema_dev.json`

## Configuration parameters¶

The table below will list all configuration parameters available.

Freqtrade can also load many options via command line (CLI) arguments (check out the commands--helpoutput for details).

`--help`

### Configuration option prevalence¶

The prevalence for all Options is as follows:

- CLI arguments override any other option
- Environment Variables
- Configuration files are used in sequence (the last file wins) and override Strategy configurations.
- Strategy configurations are only used if they are not set via configuration or command-line arguments. These options are marked withStrategy Overridein the below table.

### Parameters table¶

### Configuring amount per trade¶

There are several methods to configure how much of the stake currency the bot will use to enter a trade. All methods respect theavailable balance configurationas explained below.

#### Minimum trade stake¶

The minimum stake amount will depend on exchange and pair and is usually listed in the exchange support pages.

Assuming the minimum tradable amount for XRP/USD is 20 XRP (given by the exchange), and the price is 0.6$, the minimum stake amount to buy this pair is20 * 0.6 ~= 12.
This exchange has also a limit on USD - where all orders must be > 10$ - which however does not apply in this case.

`20 * 0.6 ~= 12`

To guarantee safe execution, freqtrade will not allow buying with a stake-amount of 10.1$, instead, it'll make sure that there's enough space to place a stoploss below the pair (+ an offset, defined byamount_reserve_percent, which defaults to 5%).

`amount_reserve_percent`

With a reserve of 5%, the minimum stake amount would be ~12.6$ (12 * (1 + 0.05)). If we take into account a stoploss of 10% on top of that - we'd end up with a value of ~14$ (12.6 / (1 - 0.1)).

`12 * (1 + 0.05)`
`12.6 / (1 - 0.1)`

To limit this calculation in case of large stoploss values, the calculated minimum stake-limit will never be more than 50% above the real limit.

Warning

Since the limits on exchanges are usually stable and are not updated often, some pairs can show pretty high minimum limits, simply because the price increased a lot since the last limit adjustment by the exchange. Freqtrade adjusts the stake-amount to this value, unless it's > 30% more than the calculated/desired stake-amount - in which case the trade is rejected.

#### Dry-run wallet¶

When running in dry-run mode, the bot will use a simulated wallet to execute trades. The starting balance of this wallet is defined bydry_run_wallet(defaults to 1000).
For more complex scenarios, you can also assign a dictionary todry_run_walletto define the starting balance for each currency.

`dry_run_wallet`
`dry_run_wallet`

```
"dry_run_wallet": {
    "BTC": 0.01,
    "ETH": 2,
    "USDT": 1000
}
```

Command line options (--dry-run-wallet) can be used to override the configuration value, but only for the float value, not for the dictionary. If you'd like to use the dictionary, please adjust the configuration file.

`--dry-run-wallet`

Note

Balances not in stake-currency will not be used for trading, but are shown as part of the wallet balance.
On Cross-margin exchanges, the wallet balance may be used to calculate the available collateral for trading.

#### Tradable balance¶

By default, the bot assumes that thecomplete amount - 1%is at it's disposal, and when usingdynamic stake amount, it will split the complete balance intomax_open_tradesbuckets per trade.
Freqtrade will reserve 1% for eventual fees when entering a trade and will therefore not touch that by default.

`complete amount - 1%`
`max_open_trades`

You can configure the "untouched" amount by using thetradable_balance_ratiosetting.

`tradable_balance_ratio`

For example, if you have 10 ETH available in your wallet on the exchange andtradable_balance_ratio=0.5(which is 50%), then the bot will use a maximum amount of 5 ETH for trading and considers this as an available balance. The rest of the wallet is untouched by the trades.

`tradable_balance_ratio=0.5`

Danger

This setting shouldnotbe used when running multiple bots on the same account. Please look atAvailable Capital to the botinstead.

Warning

Thetradable_balance_ratiosetting applies to the current balance (free balance + tied up in trades). Therefore, assuming the starting balance of 1000, a configuration withtradable_balance_ratio=0.99will not guarantee that 10 currency units will always remain available on the exchange. For example, the free amount may reduce to 5 units if the total balance is reduced to 500 (either by a losing streak or by withdrawing balance).

`tradable_balance_ratio`
`tradable_balance_ratio=0.99`

#### Assign available Capital¶

To fully utilize compounding profits when using multiple bots on the same exchange account, you'll want to limit each bot to a certain starting balance.
This can be accomplished by settingavailable_capitalto the desired starting balance.

`available_capital`

Assuming your account has 10000 USDT and you want to run 2 different strategies on this exchange.
You'd setavailable_capital=5000- granting each bot an initial capital of 5000 USDT.
The bot will then split this starting balance equally intomax_open_tradesbuckets.
Profitable trades will result in increased stake-sizes for this bot - without affecting the stake-sizes of the other bot.

`available_capital=5000`
`max_open_trades`

Adjustingavailable_capitalrequires reloading the configuration to take effect. Adjusting theavailable_capitaladds the difference between the previousavailable_capitaland the newavailable_capital. Decreasing the available capital when trades are open doesn't exit the trades. The difference is returned to the wallet when the trades conclude. The outcome of this differs depending on the price movement between the adjustment and exiting the trades.

`available_capital`
`available_capital`
`available_capital`
`available_capital`

Incompatible withtradable_balance_ratio

`tradable_balance_ratio`

Setting this option will replace any configuration oftradable_balance_ratio.

`tradable_balance_ratio`

#### Amend last stake amount¶

Assuming we have the tradable balance of 1000 USDT,stake_amount=400, andmax_open_trades=3.
The bot would open 2 trades and will be unable to fill the last trading slot, since the requested 400 USDT are no longer available since 800 USDT are already tied in other trades.

`stake_amount=400`
`max_open_trades=3`

To overcome this, the optionamend_last_stake_amountcan be set toTrue, which will enable the bot to reduce stake_amount to the available balance to fill the last trade slot.

`amend_last_stake_amount`
`True`

In the example above this would mean:

- Trade1: 400 USDT
- Trade2: 400 USDT
- Trade3: 200 USDT

Note

This option only applies withStatic stake amount- sinceDynamic stake amountdivides the balances evenly.

Note

The minimum last stake amount can be configured usinglast_stake_amount_min_ratio- which defaults to 0.5 (50%). This means that the minimum stake amount that's ever used isstake_amount * 0.5. This avoids very low stake amounts, that are close to the minimum tradable amount for the pair and can be refused by the exchange.

`last_stake_amount_min_ratio`
`stake_amount * 0.5`

#### Static stake amount¶

Thestake_amountconfiguration statically configures the amount of stake-currency your bot will use for each trade.

`stake_amount`

The minimal configuration value is 0.0001, however, please check your exchange's trading minimums for the stake currency you're using to avoid problems.

This setting works in combination withmax_open_trades. The maximum capital engaged in trades isstake_amount * max_open_trades.
For example, the bot will at most use (0.05 BTC x 3) = 0.15 BTC, assuming a configuration ofmax_open_trades=3andstake_amount=0.05.

`max_open_trades`
`stake_amount * max_open_trades`
`max_open_trades=3`
`stake_amount=0.05`

Note

This setting respects theavailable balance configuration.

#### Dynamic stake amount¶

Alternatively, you can use a dynamic stake amount, which will use the available balance on the exchange, and divide that equally by the number of allowed trades (max_open_trades).

`max_open_trades`

To configure this, setstake_amount="unlimited". We also recommend to settradable_balance_ratio=0.99(99%) - to keep a minimum balance for eventual fees.

`stake_amount="unlimited"`
`tradable_balance_ratio=0.99`

In this case a trade amount is calculated as:

```
currency_balance / (max_open_trades - current_open_trades)
```

To allow the bot to trade all the availablestake_currencyin your account (minustradable_balance_ratio) set

`stake_currency`
`tradable_balance_ratio`

```
"stake_amount" : "unlimited",
"tradable_balance_ratio": 0.99,
```

Compounding profits

This configuration will allow increasing/decreasing stakes depending on the performance of the bot (lower stake if the bot is losing, higher stakes if the bot has a winning record since higher balances are available), and will result in profit compounding.

When using Dry-Run Mode

When using"stake_amount" : "unlimited",in combination with Dry-Run, Backtesting or Hyperopt, the balance will be simulated starting with a stake ofdry_run_walletwhich will evolve.
It is therefore important to setdry_run_walletto a sensible value (like 0.05 or 0.01 for BTC and 1000 or 100 for USDT, for example), otherwise, it may simulate trades with 100 BTC (or more) or 0.05 USDT (or less) at once - which may not correspond to your real available balance or is less than the exchange minimal limit for the order amount for the stake currency.

`"stake_amount" : "unlimited",`
`dry_run_wallet`
`dry_run_wallet`

#### Dynamic stake amount with position adjustment¶

When you want to use position adjustment with unlimited stakes, you must also implementcustom_stake_amountto a return a value depending on your strategy.
Typical value would be in the range of 25% - 50% of the proposed stakes, but depends highly on your strategy and how much you wish to leave into the wallet as position adjustment buffer.

`custom_stake_amount`

For example if your position adjustment assumes it can do 2 additional buys with the same stake amounts then your buffer should be 66.6667% of the initially proposed unlimited stake amount.

Or another example if your position adjustment assumes it can do 1 additional buy with 3x the original stake amount thencustom_stake_amountshould return 25% of proposed stake amount and leave 75% for possible later position adjustments.

`custom_stake_amount`

## Prices used for orders¶

Prices for regular orders can be controlled via the parameter structuresentry_pricingfor trade entries andexit_pricingfor trade exits.
Prices are always retrieved right before an order is placed, either by querying the exchange tickers or by using the orderbook data.

`entry_pricing`
`exit_pricing`

Note

Orderbook data used by Freqtrade are the data retrieved from exchange by the ccxt's functionfetch_order_book(), i.e. are usually data from the L2-aggregated orderbook, while the ticker data are the structures returned by the ccxt'sfetch_ticker()/fetch_tickers()functions. Refer to the ccxt librarydocumentationfor more details.

`fetch_order_book()`
`fetch_ticker()`
`fetch_tickers()`

Using market orders

Please read the sectionMarket order pricingsection when using market orders.

### Entry price¶

#### Enter price side¶

The configuration settingentry_pricing.price_sidedefines the side of the orderbook the bot looks for when buying.

`entry_pricing.price_side`

The following displays an orderbook.

```
...
103
102
101  # ask
-------------Current spread
99   # bid
98
97
...
```

Ifentry_pricing.price_sideis set to"bid", then the bot will use 99 as entry price.In line with that, ifentry_pricing.price_sideis set to"ask", then the bot will use 101 as entry price.

`entry_pricing.price_side`
`"bid"`
`entry_pricing.price_side`
`"ask"`

Depending on the order direction (long/short), this will lead to different results. Therefore we recommend to use"same"or"other"for this configuration instead.
This would result in the following pricing matrix:

`"same"`
`"other"`
| direction | Order | setting | price | crosses spread |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| long | buy | ask | 101 | yes |
| long | buy | bid | 99 | no |
| long | buy | same | 99 | no |
| long | buy | other | 101 | yes |
| short | sell | ask | 101 | no |
| short | sell | bid | 99 | yes |
| short | sell | same | 101 | no |
| short | sell | other | 99 | yes |

Using the other side of the orderbook often guarantees quicker filled orders, but the bot can also end up paying more than what would have been necessary.
Taker fees instead of maker fees will most likely apply even when using limit buy orders.
Also, prices at the "other" side of the spread are higher than prices at the "bid" side in the orderbook, so the order behaves similar to a market order (however with a maximum price).

#### Entry price with Orderbook enabled¶

When entering a trade with the orderbook enabled (entry_pricing.use_order_book=True), Freqtrade fetches theentry_pricing.order_book_topentries from the orderbook and uses the entry specified asentry_pricing.order_book_topon the configured side (entry_pricing.price_side) of the orderbook. 1 specifies the topmost entry in the orderbook, while 2 would use the 2ndentry in the orderbook, and so on.

`entry_pricing.use_order_book=True`
`entry_pricing.order_book_top`
`entry_pricing.order_book_top`
`entry_pricing.price_side`

#### Entry price without Orderbook enabled¶

The following section usessideas the configuredentry_pricing.price_side(defaults to"same").

`side`
`entry_pricing.price_side`
`"same"`

When not using orderbook (entry_pricing.use_order_book=False), Freqtrade uses the bestsideprice from the ticker if it's below thelasttraded price from the ticker. Otherwise (when thesideprice is above thelastprice), it calculates a rate betweensideandlastprice based onentry_pricing.price_last_balance.

`entry_pricing.use_order_book=False`
`side`
`last`
`side`
`last`
`side`
`last`
`entry_pricing.price_last_balance`

Theentry_pricing.price_last_balanceconfiguration parameter controls this. A value of0.0will usesideprice, while1.0will use thelastprice and values between those interpolate between ask and last price.

`entry_pricing.price_last_balance`
`0.0`
`side`
`1.0`
`last`

#### Check depth of market¶

When check depth of market is enabled (entry_pricing.check_depth_of_market.enabled=True), the entry signals are filtered based on the orderbook depth (sum of all amounts) for each orderbook side.

`entry_pricing.check_depth_of_market.enabled=True`

Orderbookbid(buy) side depth is then divided by the orderbookask(sell) side depth and the resulting delta is compared to the value of theentry_pricing.check_depth_of_market.bids_to_ask_deltaparameter. The entry order is only executed if the orderbook delta is greater than or equal to the configured delta value.

`bid`
`ask`
`entry_pricing.check_depth_of_market.bids_to_ask_delta`

Note

A delta value below 1 means thatask(sell) orderbook side depth is greater than the depth of thebid(buy) orderbook side, while a value greater than 1 means opposite (depth of the buy side is higher than the depth of the sell side).

`ask`
`bid`

### Exit price¶

#### Exit price side¶

The configuration settingexit_pricing.price_sidedefines the side of the spread the bot looks for when exiting a trade.

`exit_pricing.price_side`

The following displays an orderbook:

```
...
103
102
101  # ask
-------------Current spread
99   # bid
98
97
...
```

Ifexit_pricing.price_sideis set to"ask", then the bot will use 101 as exiting price.In line with that, ifexit_pricing.price_sideis set to"bid", then the bot will use 99 as exiting price.

`exit_pricing.price_side`
`"ask"`
`exit_pricing.price_side`
`"bid"`

Depending on the order direction (long/short), this will lead to different results. Therefore we recommend to use"same"or"other"for this configuration instead.
This would result in the following pricing matrix:

`"same"`
`"other"`
| Direction | Order | setting | price | crosses spread |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| long | sell | ask | 101 | no |
| long | sell | bid | 99 | yes |
| long | sell | same | 101 | no |
| long | sell | other | 99 | yes |
| short | buy | ask | 101 | yes |
| short | buy | bid | 99 | no |
| short | buy | same | 99 | no |
| short | buy | other | 101 | yes |

#### Exit price with Orderbook enabled¶

When exiting with the orderbook enabled (exit_pricing.use_order_book=True), Freqtrade fetches theexit_pricing.order_book_topentries in the orderbook and uses the entry specified asexit_pricing.order_book_topfrom the configured side (exit_pricing.price_side) as trade exit price.

`exit_pricing.use_order_book=True`
`exit_pricing.order_book_top`
`exit_pricing.order_book_top`
`exit_pricing.price_side`

1 specifies the topmost entry in the orderbook, while 2 would use the 2ndentry in the orderbook, and so on.

#### Exit price without Orderbook enabled¶

The following section usessideas the configuredexit_pricing.price_side(defaults to"ask").

`side`
`exit_pricing.price_side`
`"ask"`

When not using orderbook (exit_pricing.use_order_book=False), Freqtrade uses the bestsideprice from the ticker if it's above thelasttraded price from the ticker. Otherwise (when thesideprice is below thelastprice), it calculates a rate betweensideandlastprice based onexit_pricing.price_last_balance.

`exit_pricing.use_order_book=False`
`side`
`last`
`side`
`last`
`side`
`last`
`exit_pricing.price_last_balance`

Theexit_pricing.price_last_balanceconfiguration parameter controls this. A value of0.0will usesideprice, while1.0will use the last price and values between those interpolate betweensideand last price.

`exit_pricing.price_last_balance`
`0.0`
`side`
`1.0`
`side`

### Market order pricing¶

When using market orders, prices should be configured to use the "correct" side of the orderbook to allow realistic pricing detection.
Assuming both entry and exits are using market orders, a configuration similar to the following must be used

```
"order_types": {
    "entry": "market",
    "exit": "market"
    // ...
  },
  "entry_pricing": {
    "price_side": "other",
    // ...
  },
  "exit_pricing":{
    "price_side": "other",
    // ...
  },
```

Obviously, if only one side is using limit orders, different pricing combinations can be used.

## Further Configuration details¶

### Understand minimal_roi¶

Theminimal_roiconfiguration parameter is a JSON object where the key is a duration
in minutes and the value is the minimum ROI as a ratio.
See the example below:

`minimal_roi`

```
"minimal_roi": {
    "40": 0.0,    # Exit after 40 minutes if the profit is not negative
    "30": 0.01,   # Exit after 30 minutes if there is at least 1% profit
    "20": 0.02,   # Exit after 20 minutes if there is at least 2% profit
    "0":  0.04    # Exit immediately if there is at least 4% profit
},
```

Most of the strategy files already include the optimalminimal_roivalue.
This parameter can be set in either Strategy or Configuration file. If you use it in the configuration file, it will override theminimal_roivalue from the strategy file.
If it is not set in either Strategy or Configuration, a default of 1000%{"0": 10}is used, and minimal ROI is disabled unless your trade generates 1000% profit.

`minimal_roi`
`minimal_roi`
`{"0": 10}`

Special case to forceexit after a specific time

A special case presents using"<N>": -1as ROI. This forces the bot to exit a trade after N Minutes, no matter if it's positive or negative, so represents a time-limited force-exit.

`"<N>": -1`

### Understand force_entry_enable¶

Theforce_entry_enableconfiguration parameter enables the usage of force-enter (/forcelong,/forceshort) commands via Telegram and REST API.
For security reasons, it's disabled by default, and freqtrade will show a warning message on startup if enabled.
For example, you can send/forceenter ETH/BTCto the bot, which will result in freqtrade buying the pair and holds it until a regular exit-signal (ROI, stoploss, /forceexit) appears.

`force_entry_enable`
`/forcelong`
`/forceshort`
`/forceenter ETH/BTC`

This can be dangerous with some strategies, so use with care.

Seethe telegram documentationfor details on usage.

### Ignoring expired candles¶

When working with larger timeframes (for example 1h or more) and using a lowmax_open_tradesvalue, the last candle can be processed as soon as a trade slot becomes available. When processing the last candle, this can lead to a situation where it may not be desirable to use the buy signal on that candle. For example, when using a condition in your strategy where you use a cross-over, that point may have passed too long ago for you to start a trade on it.

`max_open_trades`

In these situations, you can enable the functionality to ignore candles that are beyond a specified period by settingignore_buying_expired_candle_afterto a positive number, indicating the number of seconds after which the buy signal becomes expired.

`ignore_buying_expired_candle_after`

For example, if your strategy is using a 1h timeframe, and you only want to buy within the first 5 minutes when a new candle comes in, you can add the following configuration to your strategy:

```
{
    //...
    "ignore_buying_expired_candle_after": 300,
    // ...
  }
```

Note

This setting resets with each new candle, so it will not prevent sticking-signals from executing on the 2ndor 3rdcandle they're active. Best use a "trigger" selector for buy signals, which are only active for one candle.

### Understand order_types¶

Theorder_typesconfiguration parameter maps actions (entry,exit,stoploss,emergency_exit,force_exit,force_entry) to order-types (market,limit, ...) as well as configures stoploss to be on the exchange and defines stoploss on exchange update interval in seconds.

`order_types`
`entry`
`exit`
`stoploss`
`emergency_exit`
`force_exit`
`force_entry`
`market`
`limit`

This allows to enter using limit orders, exit using limit-orders, and create stoplosses using market orders.
It also allows to set the
stoploss "on exchange" which means stoploss order would be placed immediately once the buy order is fulfilled.

order_typesset in the configuration file overwrites values set in the strategy as a whole, so you need to configure the wholeorder_typesdictionary in one place.

`order_types`
`order_types`

If this is configured, the following 4 values (entry,exit,stoplossandstoploss_on_exchange) need to be present, otherwise, the bot will fail to start.

`entry`
`exit`
`stoploss`
`stoploss_on_exchange`

For information on (emergency_exit,force_exit,force_entry,stoploss_on_exchange,stoploss_on_exchange_interval,stoploss_on_exchange_limit_ratio) please see stop loss documentationstop loss on exchange

`emergency_exit`
`force_exit`
`force_entry`
`stoploss_on_exchange`
`stoploss_on_exchange_interval`
`stoploss_on_exchange_limit_ratio`

Syntax for Strategy:

```
order_types = {
    "entry": "limit",
    "exit": "limit",
    "emergency_exit": "market",
    "force_entry": "market",
    "force_exit": "market",
    "stoploss": "market",
    "stoploss_on_exchange": False,
    "stoploss_on_exchange_interval": 60,
    "stoploss_on_exchange_limit_ratio": 0.99,
}
```

Configuration:

```
"order_types": {
    "entry": "limit",
    "exit": "limit",
    "emergency_exit": "market",
    "force_entry": "market",
    "force_exit": "market",
    "stoploss": "market",
    "stoploss_on_exchange": false,
    "stoploss_on_exchange_interval": 60
}
```

Market order support

Not all exchanges support "market" orders.
The following message will be shown if your exchange does not support market orders:"Exchange <yourexchange> does not support market orders."and the bot will refuse to start.

`"Exchange <yourexchange> does not support market orders."`

Using market orders

Please carefully read the sectionMarket order pricingsection when using market orders.

Stoploss on exchange

order_types.stoploss_on_exchange_intervalis not mandatory. Do not change its value if you are
unsure of what you are doing. For more information about how stoploss works please
refer tothe stoploss documentation.

`order_types.stoploss_on_exchange_interval`

Iforder_types.stoploss_on_exchangeis enabled and the stoploss is cancelled manually on the exchange, then the bot will create a new stoploss order.

`order_types.stoploss_on_exchange`

Warning: order_types.stoploss_on_exchange failures

If stoploss on exchange creation fails for some reason, then an "emergency exit" is initiated. By default, this will exit the trade using a market order. The order-type for the emergency-exit can be changed by setting theemergency_exitvalue in theorder_typesdictionary - however, this is not advised.

`emergency_exit`
`order_types`

### Understand order_time_in_force¶

Theorder_time_in_forceconfiguration parameter defines the policy by which the order is executed on the exchange.Commonly used time in force are:

`order_time_in_force`

GTC (Good Till Canceled):

This is most of the time the default time in force. It means the order will remain on exchange till it is cancelled by the user. It can be fully or partially fulfilled. If partially fulfilled, the remaining will stay on the exchange till cancelled.

FOK (Fill Or Kill):

It means if the order is not executed immediately AND fully then it is cancelled by the exchange.

IOC (Immediate Or Canceled):

It is the same as FOK (above) except it can be partially fulfilled. The remaining part is automatically cancelled by the exchange.

Not necessarily recommended, as this can lead to partial fills below the minimum trade size.

PO (Post only):

Post only order. The order is either placed as a maker order, or it is canceled.
This means the order must be placed on orderbook for at least time in an unfilled state.

Please check theExchange documentationfor supported time in force values for your exchange.

#### time_in_force config¶

Theorder_time_in_forceparameter contains a dict with entry and exit time in force policy values.
This can be set in the configuration file or in the strategy.
Values set in the configuration file overwrite values from in the strategy, following the regularprecedence rules.

`order_time_in_force`

The possible values are:GTC(default),FOKorIOC.

`GTC`
`FOK`
`IOC`

```
"order_time_in_force": {
    "entry": "GTC",
    "exit": "GTC"
},
```

Warning

Please don't change the default value unless you know what you are doing and have researched the impact of using different values for your particular exchange.

### Fiat conversion¶

Freqtrade uses the Coingecko API to convert the coin value to it's corresponding fiat value for the Telegram reports.
The FIAT currency can be set in the configuration file asfiat_display_currency.

`fiat_display_currency`

Removingfiat_display_currencycompletely from the configuration will skip initializing coingecko, and will not show any FIAT currency conversion. This has no importance for the correct functioning of the bot.

`fiat_display_currency`

#### What values can be used for fiat_display_currency?¶

Thefiat_display_currencyconfiguration parameter sets the base currency to use for the
conversion from coin to fiat in the bot Telegram reports.

`fiat_display_currency`

The valid values are:

```
"AUD", "BRL", "CAD", "CHF", "CLP", "CNY", "CZK", "DKK", "EUR", "GBP", "HKD", "HUF", "IDR", "ILS", "INR", "JPY", "KRW", "MXN", "MYR", "NOK", "NZD", "PHP", "PKR", "PLN", "RUB", "SEK", "SGD", "THB", "TRY", "TWD", "ZAR", "USD"
```

In addition to fiat currencies, a range of crypto currencies is supported.

The valid values are:

```
"BTC", "ETH", "XRP", "LTC", "BCH", "BNB"
```

#### Coingecko Rate limit problems¶

On some IP ranges, coingecko is heavily rate-limiting.
In such cases, you may want to add your coingecko API key to the configuration.

```
{
    "fiat_display_currency": "USD",
    "coingecko": {
        "api_key": "your-api",
        "is_demo": true
    }
}
```

Freqtrade supports both Demo and Pro coingecko API keys.

The Coingecko API key is NOT required for the bot to function correctly.
It is only used for the conversion of coin to fiat in the Telegram reports, which usually also work without API key.

## Consuming exchange Websockets¶

Freqtrade can consume websockets through ccxt.pro.

Freqtrade aims ensure data is available at all times.
Should the websocket connection fail (or be disabled), the bot will fall back to REST API calls.

Should you experience problems you suspect are caused by websockets, you can disable these via the settingexchange.enable_ws, which defaults to true.

`exchange.enable_ws`

```
"exchange": {
    // ...
    "enable_ws": false,
    // ...
}
```

Should you be required to use a proxy, please refer to theproxy sectionfor more information.

Rollout

We're rolling this out slowly, ensuring stability of your bots.
Currently, usage is limited to ohlcv data streams.
It's also limited to a few exchanges, with new exchanges being added on an ongoing basis.

## Using Dry-run mode¶

We recommend starting the bot in the Dry-run mode to see how your bot will
behave and what is the performance of your strategy. In the Dry-run mode, the
bot does not engage your money. It only runs a live simulation without
creating trades on the exchange.

- Edit yourconfig.jsonconfiguration file.
`config.json`
- Switchdry-runtotrueand specifydb_urlfor a persistence database.
`dry-run`
`true`
`db_url`

```
"dry_run": true,
"db_url": "sqlite:///tradesv3.dryrun.sqlite",
```

- Remove your Exchange API key and secret (change them by empty values or fake credentials):

```
"exchange": {
    "name": "binance",
    "key": "key",
    "secret": "secret",
    ...
}
```

Once you will be happy with your bot performance running in the Dry-run mode, you can switch it to production mode.

Note

A simulated wallet is available during dry-run mode and will assume a starting capital ofdry_run_wallet(defaults to 1000).

`dry_run_wallet`

### Considerations for dry-run¶

- API-keys may or may not be provided. Only Read-Only operations (i.e. operations that do not alter account state) on the exchange are performed in dry-run mode.
- Wallets (/balance) are simulated based ondry_run_wallet.
`/balance`
`dry_run_wallet`
- Orders are simulated, and will not be posted to the exchange.
- Market orders fill based on orderbook volume the moment the order is placed, with a maximum slippage of 5%.
- Limit orders fill once the price reaches the defined level - or time out based onunfilledtimeoutsettings.
`unfilledtimeout`
- Limit orders will be converted to market orders if they cross the price by more than 1%, and will be filled immediately based regular market order rules (see point about Market orders above).
- In combination withstoploss_on_exchange, the stop_loss price is assumed to be filled.
`stoploss_on_exchange`
- Open orders (not trades, which are stored in the database) are kept open after bot restarts, with the assumption that they were not filled while being offline.

## Switch to production mode¶

In production mode, the bot will engage your money. Be careful, since a wrong strategy can lose all your money.
Be aware of what you are doing when you run it in production mode.

When switching to Production mode, please make sure to use a different / fresh database to avoid dry-run trades messing with your exchange money and eventually tainting your statistics.

### Setup your exchange account¶

You will need to create API Keys (usually you getkeyandsecret, some exchanges require an additionalpassword) from the Exchange website and you'll need to insert this into the appropriate fields in the configuration or when asked by thefreqtrade new-configcommand.
API Keys are usually only required for live trading (trading for real money, bot running in "production mode", executing real orders on the exchange) and are not required for the bot running in dry-run (trade simulation) mode. When you set up the bot in dry-run mode, you may fill these fields with empty values.

`key`
`secret`
`password`
`freqtrade new-config`

### To switch your bot in production mode¶

Edit yourconfig.jsonfile.

`config.json`

Switch dry-run to false and don't forget to adapt your database URL if set:

```
"dry_run": false,
```

Insert your Exchange API key (change them by fake API keys):

```
{
    "exchange": {
        "name": "binance",
        "key": "af8ddd35195e9dc500b9a6f799f6f5c93d89193b",
        "secret": "08a9dc6db3d7b53e1acebd9275677f4b0a04f1a5",
        //"password": "", // Optional, not needed by all exchanges)
        // ...
    }
    //...
}
```

You should also make sure to read theExchangessection of the documentation to be aware of potential configuration details specific to your exchange.

Keep your secrets secret

To keep your secrets secret, we recommend using a 2ndconfiguration for your API keys.
Simply use the above snippet in a new configuration file (e.g.config-private.json) and keep your settings in this file.
You can then start the bot withfreqtrade trade --config user_data/config.json --config user_data/config-private.json <...>to have your keys loaded.

`config-private.json`
`freqtrade trade --config user_data/config.json --config user_data/config-private.json <...>`

NEVERshare your private configuration file or your exchange keys with anyone!

## Using a proxy with Freqtrade¶

To use a proxy with freqtrade, export your proxy settings using the variables"HTTP_PROXY"and"HTTPS_PROXY"set to the appropriate values.
This will have the proxy settings applied to everything (telegram, coingecko, ...)exceptfor exchange requests.

`"HTTP_PROXY"`
`"HTTPS_PROXY"`

```
export HTTP_PROXY="http://addr:port"
export HTTPS_PROXY="http://addr:port"
freqtrade
```

### Proxy exchange requests¶

To use a proxy for exchange connections - you will have to define the proxies as part of the ccxt configuration.

```
{ 
  "exchange": {
    "ccxt_config": {
      "httpsProxy": "http://addr:port",
      "wsProxy": "http://addr:port",
    }
  }
}
```

For more information on available proxy types, please consult theccxt proxy documentation.

## Next step¶

Now you have configured your config.json, the next step is tostart your bot.
